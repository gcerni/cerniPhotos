        <p>My name is Federica, I'm italian but I live in London since 2014. I love traveling, discovering new places and taking pictures about what I see around me. I love using my camera and seeing through it.
        My passion also has always been cinema and movies. I once desired to become an actress but I'm probably too shy to stand in front of a camera.</p>
        <p>I decided then to enrol on my current course, Lv 3 Creative Media Production Y1, as I wanted to mix my love for cameras and my passion for movies. You are going to find in here short movies that I will make(or at least try to!) throughout the year, but also photographs about the making, such as locations, and reviews about films.</p>
 
        <p>Hope you will enjoy it. :)</p>
